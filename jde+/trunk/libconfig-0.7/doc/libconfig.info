1 Introduction
**************

libconfig is a library for parsing, manipulating, and writing
structured configuration files. The library features a fully re-entrant
parser and includes bindings for both the C and C++ programming
languages.

1.1 Why Another Configuration File Library?
===========================================

There are several open-source configuration file libraries available as
of this writing. This library was written because each of those
libraries falls short in one or more ways. The main features of
libconfig that set it apart from the other libraries are:

   * A fully reentrant parser. Multiple configurations can be parsed in
     concurrent threads at the same time.

   * Both C and C++ bindings, as well as hooks to allow for the
     creation of wrappers in other languages.

   * A simple, readable, structured configuration file format.

   * A low-footprint implementation (just 72K for the C library and
     138K for the C++ library) that is suitable for memory-constrained
     systems.

   * Proper documentation.

1.2 Using the Library from a C Program
======================================

To use the library from C code, include the following preprocessor
directive in your source files:


     #include <libconfig.h>


   To link with the library, specify `-lconfig' as an argument to the
linker.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Using the Library from a C++ Program,  Prev: Using the Library from a C Program,  Up: Introduction

1.3 Using the Library from a C++ Program
========================================

To use the library from C++, include the following preprocessor
directive in your source files:


     #include <libconfig.h++>


   The C++ API classes are defined in the namespace `libconfig', hence
the following statement may optionally be used:


     using namespace libconfig;


   To link with the library, specify `-lconfig++' as an argument to the
linker.

2 Configuration Files
*********************

The libconfig library supports structured, hierarchical configuration
files. The configuration file format somewhat resembles C source code.

   A configuration file consists of "settings", which include groups
and assignments. A "group" associates a collection of settings (or
other groups) with a name, while an assignment associates a single
value with a name. A "value" can have one of the four basic types
(integer, floating point number, boolean, or string), or it can be an
array of any of the aforementioned types.

   Consider the following configuration file for a hypothetical GUI
application, which illustrates all of the elements of the configuration
file grammar.


     # Example application configuration file

     version = "1.0";

     application
       {
       window
         {
         title = "My Application";
         size { w = 640; h = 480; }
         pos { x = 350; y = 250; }
         }

       splash_screen = FALSE;

       misc
         {
         pi = 3.141592654;
         columns = [ "Last Name", "First Name", "MI" ];
         }
       }


   Each setting is uniquely identified within the configuration by a
"path". The path is a dot-separated sequence of group names beginning
at a top-level group and ending at the setting itself. For example, in
our hypothetical configuration file, the path to the `x' setting is
`application.window.pos.x', while the path to the `version' setting is
simply `version'.

   The datatype of a value is determined from the format of the value
itself. If the value is enclosed in double quotes, it is treated as a
string. If it looks like an integer or floating point number, it is
treated as such. If it is either the value `TRUE' or `FALSE', it is
treated as a boolean. And if it consists of a comma-separated list of
values enclosed in square brackets, it is treated as an array. Any
value which does not meet any of the above conditions is considered
invalid and results in a parse error.

   All names are case-sensitive. They may consist only of alphanumeric
characters, dashes, and underscores, and must begin with a letter. No
other characters are allowed.

   In C and C++, integer, floating point, and string values are mapped
to the types `long', `double', and `const char *', respectively. The
boolean type is mapped to `int' in C and `bool' in C++.

   The following sections describe the elements of the configuration
file grammar in additional detail.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Groups,  Next: Assignments,  Up: Configuration Files

2.1 Groups
==========

A group definition has the form:

   name {    settings ...  }

   An optional semicolon may appear after the closing brace.

   Groups can contain any number of settings, and can be nested to
arbitrary depth.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Assignments,  Next: Arrays,  Prev: Groups,  Up: Configuration Files

2.2 Assignments
===============

An assignment has the form:

   name = value ;

   The trailing semicolon is required.

   The value may be a simple value or an array.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Arrays,  Next: Integer Values,  Prev: Assignments,  Up: Configuration Files

2.3 Arrays
==========

An array has the form:

   [ value, value ... ]

   An array may have zero or more elements, but the elements must all
be of the same type.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Integer Values,  Next: Floating Point Values,  Prev: Arrays,  Up: Configuration Files

2.4 Integer Values
==================

Integers must consist only of digits, and may have an optional leading
sign character (`+' or `-').


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Floating Point Values,  Next: Boolean Values,  Prev: Integer Values,  Up: Configuration Files

2.5 Floating Point Values
=========================

Floating point values must consist only of digits, one decimal point, an
optional leading sign character (`+' or `-'), and an optional exponent.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Boolean Values,  Next: String Values,  Prev: Floating Point Values,  Up: Configuration Files

2.6 Boolean Values
==================

Boolean values may have one of the following two values: `TRUE',
`FALSE'.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: String Values,  Next: Comments,  Prev: Boolean Values,  Up: Configuration Files

2.7 String Values
=================

String values consist of arbitrary text delimited by double quotes.
Literal double quotes can be escaped by preceding them with a
backslash: `\"'. The escape sequences `\\', `\f', `\n', `\r', and `\t'
are also recognized, and have the usual meaning. No other escape
sequences are currently supported.


File: libconfig.info,  Node: Comments,  Prev: String Values,  Up: Configuration Files

2.8 Comments
============

Three types of comments are allowed within a configuration:

   * Script-style comments. All text beginning with a `#' character to
     the end of the line is ignored.

   * C-style comments. All text, including line breaks, between a
     starting `/*' sequence and an ending `*/' sequence is ignored.

   * C++-style comments. All text beginning with a `//' sequence to the
     end of the line is ignored.


   As expected, comment delimiters appearing within quoted strings are
treated as literal text.

   Comments are ignored when the configuration is read in, so they are
not treated as part of the configuration. Therefore if the
configuration is written back out to a stream, any comments that were
present in the original configuration will be lost.

3 The C API
***********

This chapter describes the C library API. The type config_t represents
a configuration, and the type config_setting_t represents a
configuration setting.

 -- Function: void config_init (config_t *CONFIG)
 -- Function: void config_destroy (config_t *CONFIG)
     These functions initialize and destroy the configuration object
     CONFIG.

     `config_init()' initializes CONFIG as a new, empty configuration.

     `config_destroy()' destroys the configuration CONFIG, deallocating
     all memory associated with the configuration, but not including
     the config_t structure itself.


 -- Function: int config_read (config_t *CONFIG, FILE *STREAM)
     This function reads and parses a configuration from the given
     STREAM into the configuration object CONFIG. It returns `1' on
     success, or `0' on failure; the `config_error_text()' and
     `config_error_line()' functions, described below, can be used to
     obtain information about the error.


 -- Function: int config_load_file (config_t *CONFIG, const char *FNAME)
     This function reads and parses a configuration from the file named
     FNAME into the configuration object CONFIG. It returns `1' on
     success, or `0' on failure; the `config_error_text()' and
     `config_error_line()' functions, described below, can be used to
     obtain information about the error.


 -- Function: void config_write (const config_t *CONFIG, FILE *STREAM)
     This function writes the configuration CONFIG to the given STREAM.


 -- Function: int config_save_file (config_t *CONFIG, const char *FNAME)
     This function writes the configuration CONFIG to the file named
     FNAME. It returns `1' on success, or `0' on failure; the
     `config_error_text()' and `config_error_line()' functions,
     described below, can be used to obtain information about the error.


 -- Function: const char * config_error_text (const config_t *CONFIG)
 -- Function: int config_error_line (const config_t *CONFIG)
     These functions, which are implemented as macros, return the text
     and line number of the parse error, if one occurred during a call
     to `config_read()'.


 -- Function: long config_lookup_int (const config_t *CONFIG,
          const char *PATH)
 -- Function: double config_lookup_float (const config_t *CONFIG,
          const char *PATH)
 -- Function: int config_lookup_bool (const config_t *CONFIG,
          const char *PATH)
 -- Function: const char * config_lookup_string
          (const config_t *CONFIG, const char *PATH)
     These functions locate the setting in the configuration CONFIG
     specified by the path PATH. They return the value of the setting
     on success, or a 0 or `NULL' value if the setting was not found or
     if the type of the value did not match the type requested.


 -- Function: const config_setting_t * config_lookup
          (const config_t *CONFIG, const char *PATH)
     This function locates the setting in the configuration CONFIG
     specified by the path PATH. It returns a pointer to the
     `config_setting_t' structure on success, or `NULL' if the setting
     was not found.


 -- Function: long config_setting_get_int
          (const config_setting_t *SETTING)
 -- Function: double config_setting_get_float
          (const config_setting_t *SETTING)
 -- Function: int config_setting_get_bool
          (const config_setting_t *SETTING)
 -- Function: const char * config_setting_get_string
          (const config_setting_t *SETTING)
     These functions return the value of the given SETTING. If the type
     of the setting does not match the type requested, a 0 or `NULL'
     value is returned.


 -- Function: int config_setting_set_int (config_setting_t *SETTING,
          long VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_setting_set_float (config_setting_t *SETTING,
          double VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_setting_set_bool (config_setting_t *SETTING,
          int VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_setting_set_string (config_setting_t *SETTING,
          const char *VALUE)
     These functions set the value of the given SETTING to VALUE. On
     success, they return 1. If the setting does not match the type of
     the value, they return 0.


 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_setting_get_member
          (const config_setting_t *SETTING, const char *NAME)
     This function fetches the child setting named NAME from the group
     SETTING. It returns the requested setting on success, or `NULL' if
     the setting was not found or if SETTING is not a group.


 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_setting_get_elem
          (const config_setting_t *SETTING, int INDEX)
     This function fetches the element at the given INDEX in the array
     SETTING. It returns the requested setting on success, or `NULL' if
     INDEX is out of range or if SETTING is not an array.


 -- Function: long config_setting_get_int_elem
          (const config_setting_t *ARRAY, int INDEX)
 -- Function: double config_setting_get_float_elem
          (const config_setting_t *ARRAY, int INDEX)
 -- Function: int config_setting_get_bool_elem
          (const config_setting_t *ARRAY, int INDEX)
 -- Function: const char * config_setting_get_string_elem
          (const config_setting_t *ARRAY, int INDEX)
     These functions fetch the value at the specified INDEX in the
     setting ARRAY. If the setting ARRAY is not an array, or if the
     type of the element does not match the type requested, or if INDEX
     is out of range, a 0 or `NULL' value is returned.


 -- Function: int config_setting_set_int_elem (config_setting_t *ARRAY,
          int INDEX, long VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_setting_set_float_elem
          (config_setting_t *ARRAY, int INDEX, double VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_setting_set_bool_elem
          (config_setting_t *ARRAY, int INDEX, int VALUE)
 -- Function: int config_setting_set_string_elem
          (config_setting_t *ARRAY, int INDEX, const char *VALUE)
     These functions set the value at the specified INDEX in the
     setting ARRAY to VALUE. On success, they return 1. If the type of
     the array does not match the type of the value, or if INDEX is out
     of range, they return 0.


 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_setting_add
          (config_setting_t *PARENT, const char *NAME, int TYPE)
     This function adds a new child setting or a new array element to
     the setting PARENT, which must be a group or array. If PARENT is
     an array, the NAME parameter is ignored and may be `NULL'.

     The function returns the new setting on success, or `NULL' if
     PARENT is not a group, if there is already a child setting of
     PARENT named NAME, or if TYPE is invalid.


 -- Function: int config_setting_remove (config_setting_t *PARENT,
          const char *NAME)
     This function removes the setting named NAME from the parent
     setting PARENT. Any child settings of the setting are recursively
     destroyed as well.

     The function returns 1 on success. If PARENT is not a group, or if
     it has no setting with the given name, it returns 0.


 -- Function: config_setting_t * config_root_setting
          (const config_t *CONFIG)
     This function returns the root setting for the configuration
     CONFIG. The root setting is an unnamed group.


 -- Function: const char * config_setting_name
          (const config_setting_t *SETTING)
     This function returns the name of the given SETTING.


 -- Function: int config_setting_length
          (const config_setting_t *SETTING)
     If SETTING is a group, this function returns the number of members
     in the group. If it is an array, it returns the number of elements
     in the array. Otherwise, it returns 0.


 -- Function: int config_setting_type (const config_setting_t *SETTING)
     This function returns the type of the given SETTING. The return
     value is one of the constants `CONFIG_TYPE_GROUP',
     `CONFIG_TYPE_INT', `CONFIG_TYPE_FLOAT', `CONFIG_TYPE_STRING',
     `CONFIG_TYPE_BOOL', or `CONFIG_TYPE_ARRAY'.


 -- Function: void config_setting_set_hook
          (const config_setting_t *SETTING, void *HOOK)
 -- Function: void * config_setting_get_hook
          (const config_setting_t *SETTING)
     These functions make it possible to attach arbitrary data to each
     setting structure. The destructor function, if one has been
     supplied via a call to `config_set_destructor()', will be called
     by the library to dispose of this data when the setting itself is
     deallocated.


 -- Function: void config_set_destructor (config_t *CONFIG,
          void (*DESTRUCTOR)(void *))
     This function assigns the destructor function DESTRUCTOR for the
     configuration CONFIG. This function accepts a single `void *'
     argument and has no return value. See `config_setting_set_hook()'
     above for more information.

4 The C++ API
*************

This chapter describes the C++ library API. The class Config represents
a configuration, and the class Setting represents a configuraiton
setting.

   The library defines a group of exceptions, all of which extend the
common base exception ConfigException.

   A SettingTypeException is thrown when the type of a setting's value
does not match the type requested.

   A SettingNotFoundException is thrown when a setting is not found.

   A SettingExistsException is thrown when an attempt is made to add a
new setting with a non-unique name.

   A ParseException is thrown when a parse error occurs while reading a
configuration from a stream. The following methods are available to
obtain the error details:

   A FileIOException is thrown when an I/O error occurs while
reading/writing a configuration form/to a file.

 -- Method on ParseException: const char * getError ()
 -- Method on ParseException: int getLine ()
     These methods return the text and line number of the parse error.


   The remainder of this chapter describes the member functions for
manipulating configurations and configuration settings.

 -- Method on Config:  Config ()
 -- Method on Config:  ~Config ()
     These methods create and destroy Config objects.


 -- Method on Config: void read (FILE *STREAM)
 -- Method on Config: void write (FILE *STREAM)
     The `read()' method reads and parses a configuration from the given
     STREAM. A ParseException is thrown if a parse error occurs.

     The `write()' method writes the configuration to the given STREAM.


 -- Method on Config: void loadFile (const char *FNAME)
 -- Method on Config: void saveFile (const char *FNAME)
     The `loadFile()' method reads and parses a configuration from the
     file named FNAME. A ParseException is thrown if a parse error
     occurs. A FileIOException is thrown if the file cannot be read.

     The `saveFile()' method writes the configuration to the file named
     FNAME. A FileIOException is thrown if the file cannot be written.


 -- Method on Config: Setting & lookup (const std::string & PATH)
 -- Method on Config: Setting & lookup (const char * PATH)
     These methods locate the setting specified by the path PATH. If
     the requested setting is not found, a SettingNotFoundException is
     thrown.

     A `Setting' object may be assigned to a variable of type bool if
     it is of type `TypeBoolean', int or long if it is of type
     `TypeInt', float or double if it is of type `TypeFloat', or
     const char * or std::string if it is of type `TypeString'.

     The following example demonstrates this usage:

          long width = config.lookup("application.window.size.w");

          bool splashScreen = config.lookup("application.splash_screen");

     If the assignment is invalid due to a type mismatch, a
     SettingTypeException is thrown.

     A Setting object may also be subscripted with an integer index if
     it is an array, or with either a string index or an integer index
     if it is a group. For example, the following expression would
     return the string `Last Name' when applied to the example
     configuration in *Note Configuration Files::.


          const Setting& setting = config.lookup("application.misc");
          const char *s = setting["columns"][0];

     Iterating over a group's child settings with an integer index will
     return the settings in the same order that they appear in the
     configuration.


 -- Method on Config: Setting & getRoot ()
     This function returns the root setting for the configuration. The
     root setting is an unnamed group.


 -- Method on Setting: Setting & add (const std::string & NAME,
          SettingType TYPE)
 -- Method on Setting: Setting & add (const char *NAME,
          SettingType TYPE)
     These methods add a new child setting with the given NAME and TYPE
     to the setting, returning a reference to the new setting. If the
     setting already has a child setting with the given name, a
     `SettingExistsException' is thrown.

     Once a setting has been created, neither its name nor type can be
     changed.


 -- Method on Setting: Setting & add (SettingType TYPE)
     This method adds a new, unnamed child setting to the setting, which
     must be of type `TypeArray'. If the array currently has zero
     elements, the TYPE parameter (which must be `TypeInt',
     `TypeFloat', `TypeBool', or `TypeString') determines the type for
     the array, otherwise it must match the type of the existing
     elements in the array.

     The method returns the new setting on success. The setting will
     have a default value of 0, 0.0, `false', or `NULL', depending on
     the type.

     The method throws a `SettingTypeException' if the setting is not
     an array, or if TYPE is invalid.


 -- Method on Setting: void remove (const std::string & NAME)
 -- Method on Setting: void remove (const char * NAME)
     These methods remove the child setting with the given NAME from
     the setting, which must be a group. Any child settings of the
     setting are recursively destroyed as well.

     If the setting is not a group, a `SettingTypeException' is thrown.
     If the setting does not have a child setting with the given name,
     a `SettingNotFoundException' is thrown.


 -- Method on Setting: const char * getName ()
     This method returns the name of the setting.


 -- Method on Setting: SettingType getType ()
     This method returns the type of the setting. The `SettingType'
     enumeration consists of the following constants: `TypeNone',
     `TypeGroup', `TypeInt', `TypeFloat', `TypeString', `TypeBoolean',
     `TypeArray'.


 -- Method on Setting: int getLength ()
     If the setting is a group, this function returns the number of
     members in the group. If it is an array, it returns the number of
     elements in the array. Otherwise, it returns 0.

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also
counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,
hence the version number 2.1.]


                               Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software-to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages-typically libraries-of the Free
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this
license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to
use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that
what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is
quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this
license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire
combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public
License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the
library.

   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public
License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an
advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the
reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.
However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special
circumstances.

   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must
be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system,
as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked
with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program
using a modified version of the Library.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION


  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
     program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
     other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the
     terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this
     License").  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

     A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
     prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
     (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

     The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
     which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on
     the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter,
     translation is included without limitation in the term
     "modification".)

     "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code
     means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
     control compilation and installation of the library.

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and
     output from such a program is covered only if its contents
     constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of
     the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true
     depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
     the Library does.


  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
     complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
     that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
     intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
     absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
     along with the Library.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.


  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. The modified work must itself be a software library.


       b. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.


       c. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
          charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.


       d. If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or
          a table of data to be supplied by an application program that
          uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the
          facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
          to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply
          such function or table, the facility still operates, and
          performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

          (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots
          has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of
          the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
          application-supplied function or table used by this function
          must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
          square root function must still compute square roots.)


     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Library.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.


  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
     License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.
     To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this
     License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public
     License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer
     version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License
     has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
     wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.

     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
     that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to
     all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
     Library into a program that is not a library.


  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
     derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
     form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
     accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
     interchange.

     If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
     the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
     distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.


  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
     Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being
     compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the
     Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
     the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

     However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
     creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because
     it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that
     uses the library".  The executable is therefore covered by this
     License.  Section 6 states terms for distribution of such
     executables.

     When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header
     file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may
     be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
     not.  Whether this is true is especially significant if the work
     can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
     library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
     defined by law.

     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
     structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
     functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the
     object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a
     derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus
     portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
     distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section
     6.  Any executables containing that work also fall under Section
     6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.


  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
     link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
     work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
     under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
     modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
     engineering for debugging such modifications.

     You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
     by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the
     work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include
     the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a
     reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also,
     you must do one of these things:


       a. Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
          machine-readable source code for the Library including
          whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
          distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work
          is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
          machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
          and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library
          and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
          the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who
          changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will
          not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use
          the modified definitions.)


       b. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
          Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run
          time a copy of the library already present on the user's
          computer system, rather than copying library functions into
          the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
          version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as
          the modified version is interface-compatible with the version
          that the work was made with.


       c. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
          three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
          Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
          performing this distribution.


       d. If distribution of the work is made by offering access to
          copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy
          the above specified materials from the same place.


       e. Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
          materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.


     For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
     Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
     reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special
     exception, the materials to be distributed need not include
     anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
     form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of
     the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
     component itself accompanies the executable.

     It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
     restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
     accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you
     cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable
     that you distribute.


  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
     Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
     library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
     such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution
     of the work based on the Library and of the other library
     facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these
     two things:


       a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
          based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
          facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
          Sections above.


       b. Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
          that part of it is a work based on the Library, and
          explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of
          the same work.



  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
     Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
     attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
     distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
     your rights under this License.  However, parties who have
     received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
     have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
     full compliance.


  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
     based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.


 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
     Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the
     Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose
     any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties with this License.


 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Library.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.


 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.


 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
     version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
     concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Library specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library
     does not specify a license version number, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.


 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with
     these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software
     which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the
     Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
     Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the
     free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
     promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.


                                NO WARRANTY

 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.


 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
the ordinary General Public License).

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is
found.


<one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307  USA

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:


Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
